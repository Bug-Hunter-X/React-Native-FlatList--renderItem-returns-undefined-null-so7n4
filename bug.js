This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an incorrect or incomplete `renderItem` function.  The `renderItem` function is responsible for rendering each item in the `FlatList`, and if it doesn't return a valid React component, you'll get this error.  Specifically, if `renderItem` returns `undefined` or `null`, the error may not always be immediately apparent, leading to a seemingly blank list or unexpected behavior.
